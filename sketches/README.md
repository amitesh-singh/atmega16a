# Arduino Sketches

This directory contains sketches created with the Arduino libraries.
Arduino code is usually tainted by GPL, so this code is kept separate.

## Sketches

The sketches ported over (well, copied) from ubirch-sketches.

- fewl (the re:publica 2015 code)
- hc-sr04-intr (doing distance sensing using interrupts)
- hc-sr04-led (distance sensor + led)
- internals (show voltage and temperature of the Atmel)
- interrupts (just a small example to configure interrupts)
- sim800h (a modem terminal, proxying the SIM800H to the serial port)
